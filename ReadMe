UIPageViewController

This project demonstrate how to create UIPageViewController class and implement UIPageViewControllerDatasource and UIPageViewControllerDelegates.

An array of colours is created. A single view controller is added in storyboard.

When you swipe the page view controller, a new view controller instance is created and based on index, the background color of view is updated.

Though we are using the same view controller instance, after swiping pages left and right, we will be updating background colours of the view.
