UIPageViewController

This project demonstrate how to create UIPageViewController class and implement UIPageViewControllerDatasource and UIPageViewControllerDelegates.

Create a int type and call it as 'index'.

Create an array and add colours as objects.

Create a view controller in storyboard. Set restoration id for the view controller.

When you swipe the page view controller, using restoration id, a new view controller instance is created.

After swiping pages left and right, we will be updating background colours of the view based on the 'index' value. The colour is fetched from colour array.
